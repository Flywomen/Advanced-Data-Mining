System design from course project IIT CS522

for Evaluation of LSA and LDA
Goal:
 Evaluate the dimensionality reduction techniques LSA and LDA. Use 2 data sets. The first data set is one of the standard research data sets, 20 NewsGroups. The second is the Yelp review data set from the Yelp data Challenge. Compute the LSA and LDA representation for documents from both data sets and evaluate if it help to achieve better performance for clustering

for Hierarchical Dataless Classification
Goal:
1.Extended the dataless classifier approach to extract hierarchical categories from Wikipedia, constructed summary representations for the higher levels of categories.
2.Analyzed if they can be used for hierarchical categorization by applying Explicit Semantic Analysis to derive meaning and build up word vectors for each concept.
